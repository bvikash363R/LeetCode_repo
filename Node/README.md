# Data Structures: Node-Based Implementations (Linked List & Tree)

This package contains implementations of fundamental data structures based on the `Node` concept, including:

- **Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)**
- **Tree Structures (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)**

## ðŸ“¦ Package Contents

### 1. Linked List
- `Node` class for singly and doubly linked lists
- Singly Linked List operations:
  - Insert (beginning, end, position)
  - Delete (by value, position)
  - Search
  - Traverse
- Doubly Linked List operations
- Circular Linked List support

### 2. Tree
- `TreeNode` class for tree structures
- Binary Tree operations:
  - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals
- Binary Search Tree (BST) operations:
  - Insert
  - Delete
  - Search
  - Traverse

## ðŸ“˜ Usage
